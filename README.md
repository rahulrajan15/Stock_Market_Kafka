# Real-Time Stock Market Data Science Project using Apache Kafka
In this project, you will execute an End-To-End Data Engineering Project on Real-Time Stock Market Data using Kafka.
We are going to use different technologies such as Python, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Apache Kafka, Glue, Athena, and SQL.
The Real-Time Stock Market Data Science Project using Apache Kafka is a cutting-edge initiative focused on leveraging Kafka's streaming capabilities to analyze and process stock market data in real-time. 
By integrating various data sources and applying advanced data science techniques, this project aims to extract valuable insights, identify trends, and predict market movements. The system will ensure low-latency data ingestion and scalable processing to handle high data volumes. 
Through this project, we aim to provide traders, investors, and financial analysts with timely, accurate, and actionable information to make informed decisions in the fast-paced and dynamic stock market landscape.

## Technology Used
1) Programming Language - Python
2) Amazon Web Service (AWS) : 
  S3 (Simple Storage Service), Athena, Glue Crawler, Glue Catalog, EC2
3) Apache Kafka

# Dataset Used

# What is Apache Kafka
Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used by thousands of companies for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications.

# Who uses Apache Kafka
Some of the major brands currently leading Apache Kafka development in enterprise are:
1) Uber
2) Twitter
3) Splunk
4) Lyft
5) Netflix
6) Walmart
7) Tesla  etc etc.....

# Why use to use Kafka?
Apache Kafka creates an event variable with a record, timestamp, key value for data colocation, and header for metadata code. 
Events can monitor platform activity from websites and mobile applications or return values from IoT devices in manufacturing and environmental research. 
Each event receives a unique key value that is never reused and is stored in data archives where they can be processed for use in both real-time and historical analytics.

# Benefits of Apache Kafka
The key benefit of Apache Kafka is that organizations can adopt streaming data architecture to build custom software services that store and process “big data” 
according to the particular requirements of their industry or business model.

# Key advantages of Apache Kafka for enterprise software development are;
1) Processing Speed
2) Platform Scalability
3) Pre-Built Integrators
4) Managed Cloud
5) Real-time Analytics
